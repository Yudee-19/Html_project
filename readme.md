# Hi, I'm Yudee! 👋

Today is 2nd Jan 2023.
time is 12:30 a.m.
2nd day of the year and I am here making this readme file for hosting my first Html_project.

# Html_project

So, this is my first practice HTML file that I have created.
I tried to use all the important tags to make this not so good looking wesite.
Note: Not a single line of CSS was used while making this.
Also this is my first github contribution. So a big round of applause for me..👏👏
